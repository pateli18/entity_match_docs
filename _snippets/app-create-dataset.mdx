Before you can start a job, you need to create a dataset. You can do that in the [App](https://www.getaugerdata.com/datasets) by clicking the `New Dataset` button. Right now the application will only accept CSV files.

Your dataset should only include the fields relevant for the task (this can be multiple fields), you can either edit the dataset before uploading or enter the specific `Columns` in the upload form.
