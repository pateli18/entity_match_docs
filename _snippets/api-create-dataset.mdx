Before you can start your job, you need to create a dataset. You can do that with the [Upsert Dataset](/documentation/api-reference/dataset/upsert-dataset) endpoint. Because you are creating a new dataset, be sure to pass `id_column` and `name` in the request body.

Make sure to take note of the `dataset_id` in the response as you'll need it for starting a job with the API. You can always get the `dataset_id` by using the [Get Datasets](/documentation/api-reference/dataset/get-datasets) endpoint.
