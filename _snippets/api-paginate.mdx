When retrieving results with the api, the response will be paginated. Here's an example of how you can handle that in python to retrieve all of the results:

```python
import requests

page = 1
data = []
while page is not None:
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://app.entitymatcher.com/api/v1/{job_type}/all/{job_id}?page={page}",
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer xxxxx"},
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    response = response.json()
    page += 1
    data.extend(response['results'])
    if page > response['pagination']['total_pages']:
        page = None
```
