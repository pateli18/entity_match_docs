### 1. Create a Dataset

Before you can match records, you need to create a dataset. You can do that in the [App](https://www.entitymatcher.com/datasets) by clicking the `New Dataset` button. Right now the application will only accept CSV files.

<Info>If you want to match between two datasets, make sure to create both datasets</Info>

### 2. Start a Match Job

Once your datasets have been created, it's time to kick off a match job. You can do that in the [App](https://www.entitymatcher.com/) by clicking the `Match Records` button.

<Info>The `Base Dataset` and `Match Dataset` can be the same if you want to match records within an existing dataset, otherwise, for every record in the `Base Dataset` the system will try to match any record from the `Match Dataset`.</Info>

Since matching can take a while, you can see the progress on the job's page which will update automatically ever 30 seconds. You will also receive an email when the job is complete, so feel free to navigate away from the page if needed.

### 3. Exporting Your Matches

Once the match job is complete, you can click the `Export Data` button to get the corresponding `base_dataset_id` and `match_dataset_id` values in a `csv` file. If there was no match, the `match_dataset_id` will be blank.
