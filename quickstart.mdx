## Getting Started

You can use `EntityMatcher` in three ways:
* **API** - for developers who want to integrate EntityMatcher into their applications
* **Application** - for business users who want to use EntityMatcher without writing code
* **Google Sheets** - for business users who want to use EntityMatcher within their existing data workflows

Visit one of the following pages to get started:
* [Match](/match/overview) enables you to automatically determine if two entities (people, businesses, products, places, etc.) are the same
* [Transform](/transform/overview) enables you to automatically extract and format multiple values from your data records
* [Categorize](/categorize/overview) enables you to automatically tag and bucket your data records for easier organization
