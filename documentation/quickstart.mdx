## Getting Started

You can use `EntityMatcher` in three ways:
* **API** - for developers who want to integrate EntityMatcher into their applications
* **Application** - for users who want to use EntityMatcher without writing code
* **Google Sheets** - for users who want to use EntityMatcher within their existing data workflows

Visit one of the following pages to get started:
* [Match](/documentation/match/overview) enables you to automatically determine if two entities (people, businesses, products, places, etc.) are the same
* [Transform](/documentation/transform/overview) enables you to automatically extract and format multiple values from your data records
* [Categorize](/documentation/categorize/overview) enables you to automatically tag and bucket your data records for easier organization

We also cover some specific use cases in our Tutorials section:
* [Qualitative Data Coding](/tutorials/qualitative_data_coding) shows researchers how to automatically code qualitative data (e.g. survey responses, open-ended questions, etc.)
