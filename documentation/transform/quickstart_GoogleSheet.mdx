### 4. Start a Transform Job

If all the data that you want is in the same worksheet, use the `=ENTITYTRANSFORM` custom formula. Here's an example formula:

```
=ENTITYTRANSFORM(A1:E44, "id", "get the vendor and indicate whether the product is software or not, two separate fields", "plugin-transform-test-v1")
```

- The first parameter covers the `dataset` which is the dataset with every record that you want to be transformed. This should be a range of cells
- The second parameter is the `id_column` which is the column in the `dataset` that contains the unique identifier for each record. This should be a value, not a cell
- The third parameter covers the `user_instructions` which is the instructions that are passed to the application describing the transformation that you want to perform. This should be a value, not a cell
- The fourth parameter is the `transform_job_name` which is the name of the transform job that you want to use. This should be unique within the worksheet if you are using multiple transform jobs

<Warning>For the `dataset`, select the entire dataset, including the column headers, and not just the individual rows</Warning>

Once you press enter, the relevant cells will be populated with `Loading...`
