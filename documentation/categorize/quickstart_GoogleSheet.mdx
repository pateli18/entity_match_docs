### 4. Start a Categorize Job

If all the data that you want is in the same worksheet, use the `=ENTITYCATEGORIZE` custom formula. Here's an example formula:

```
=ENTITYCATEGORIZE(A1:E44, "id", I2:I3, "plugin-categorize-test-v1")
```

- The first parameter covers the `dataset` which is the dataset with every record that you want to be categorized. This should be a range of cells
- The second parameter is the `id_column` which is the column in the `dataset` that contains the unique identifier for each record. This should be a value, not a cell
- The third parameter covers the `categories` which are the set of categories the application should choose from. This should be a range of cells
- The fourth parameter is the `categorize_job_name` which is the name of the categorize job that you want to use. This should be unique within the worksheet if you are using multiple categorize jobs

<Warning>For the `dataset`, select the entire dataset, including the column headers, and not just the individual rows</Warning>

Once you press enter, the relevant cells will be populated with `Loading...`
