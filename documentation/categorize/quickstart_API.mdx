### 1. Get Your API Key

<Snippet file="api-key.mdx" />

### 2. Create a Dataset

<Snippet file="api-create-dataset.mdx" />

### 3. Start a Categorize Job

Once your dataset has been created, it's time to kick off a categorize job. You can do that with the [Start Categorize Job](/documentation/api-reference/categorize/start-categorize-job) endpoint. Because you are creating a new categorize job, be sure to pass in the `dataset_id`, `name`, and `categories` parameters in the body. 

Since categorizing can take a while, the system will return a response that contains the `job_id`, which you can then use to poll for the status of the job with the [Get Categorize Job Status](/documentation/api-reference/categorize/get-categorize-job-status) endpoint. Alternatively you can pass in a `callback_url` to the [Start Categorize Job](/documentation/api-reference/categorize/start-categorize-job) request and the system will `POST` a request there once it is complete.

### 4. Retrieving Your Categorizations

Once a categorize job is complete, you can call the [Get All Categories](/documentation/api-reference/categorize/get-all-categories) endpoint with the `job_id` from the previous step.
