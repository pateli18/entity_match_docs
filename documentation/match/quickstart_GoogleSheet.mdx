### 4. Start a Match Job

If all the data that you want is in the same worksheet, use the `=ENTITYMATCH` custom formula. Here's an example formula:

```
=ENTITYMATCH(A1:E51,"id", google!A1:E44, "id", "test_google_sheets_matching")
```

- The first parameter covers the `base_dataset` which is the dataset with every record that you want to be matched. This should be a range of cells
- The second parameter is the `base_id_column` which is the column in the `base_dataset` that contains the unique identifier for each record. This should be a value, not a cell
- The third parameter covers the `match_dataset` which is the dataset with the records that you want to match against the `base_dataset`. This can be the same as the `base_dataset` if you are, for example, trying to de-duplicate the dataset. Thisb should be a range of cells
- The fourth parameter is the `match_id_column` which is the column in the `match_dataset` that contains the unique identifier for each record. This should be a value, not a cell
- The fifth parameter is the `match_job_name` which is the name of the match job that you want to use. This should be unique within the worksheet if you are using multiple match jobs

<Warning>For the `base_dataset` and `match_dataset`, select the entire datasets, including the column headers, and not just the individual rows</Warning>

Once you press enter, the relevant cells will be populated with `Loading...`
